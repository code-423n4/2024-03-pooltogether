👋 Hello and welcome to the audit channel for the $36,500 in USDC **PoolTogether** audit!

📆 Audit opens 03/04/2024 20:00 (20:00 UTC) and runs through 03/11/2024 19:00 (20:00 UTC) (7 days).

ℹ️ **New approach to warden questions:** For this audit, we’re piloting a new Q&A process. Please help us test it out!

1. **Ask your question via private thread:** Create a private thread asking your question and tag in @RaymondFam, who will be helping wardens with questions throughout the audit.
2. 🤖 **Documentation bot assistance:** While waiting for a response, you will have an option to get an answer from our documentation bot. The bot will make its best attempt to answer based on the codebase and documentation, and link you to relevant resources.
3. 🧑‍💻 **Human help appears!** @RaymondFam will review warden questions daily and reply to either validate the documentation bot answer, or provide additional clarification. 
4. ❌ **Please don’t tag the sponsor team.** @RaymondFam will escalate any complex or challenging questions to the sponsor team. 
5. :c4: **C4 staff will monitor all question threads,** so if you have any questions or concerns about this process, you can ask those in-thread too. 

We'll be posting relevant links, documentation, etc. here, so if you intend to participate in this audit, consider enabling notifications for this channel. 🐺 ⏰

[03/06/2024 00:58] raymondfam
Under normal operation, (_totalAssets >= totalDebt_) is mandated to facilitate deposit. For example, if you don't have yield buffer in place for a newly and permissionlessly deployed Prize Vault, after the first deposit is made it will turned into lossy state right away because the yield vault would round down each time a deposit/withdraw is made by a single unit (or 1 wei if 18 decimal token is entailed).   

In the NatSpec comment of yieldBuffer, an example where a reasonable yield buffer for USDC with 6 decimals might be 1e5 ($0.10), which will cover up to 100k rounding errors while still being an insignificant value is given. It simply means the yield vault could afford to do nothing while facilitating 100k deposits/withdraws.

I think u should do a private thread, or at least tag raymondFam so that the bot responds


[03/06/2024 08:48] 0xauditism
```
@> As a rule of thumb, assets with lower PPD than USDC should not be assumed to be compatible since
    /// the potential loss of a single unit rounding error is likely too high to be made up by yield at 
    /// a reasonable rate. 
```
should we consider lower PPD tokens are out of scope ?


[03/06/2024 09:53] brivan
When creating a private thread, should I tag the lookout so the bot starts suggesting answers? Some questions I'm sure they can be answered easily by the bot. It would be annoying to bother the lookout by tagging him so the bot can start chatting

For now, we require tagging the lookout because there's no guarantee that the question will be answered perfectly. It's always faster for Raymond to confirm or not a question rather than crafting one from scratch.

You can always close the thread if you think the answer is enough for you.

Correct. It is going to be a one way swap to prizeToken specific to the chain.

Gas saving only?

This function is included to allow approval and deposit in one tx. The function doesn't need the  `_owner` param, but it was included for backwards interface compatibility with the old vault contract.

quick question: is there always a single PrizePool contract each chain? And the prizeToken is always POOL token?


[03/07/2024 08:34] pkqs90
Seems the "Prize token" listed on cabina app for each vault is actually refering to the token symbol of PrizeVault, instead of the prize token that is sent to PrizePool, which would always be POOL. Is this correct?

Creating a new Vault is the primary way in which to extend PoolTogether. Vaults represents asset and yield source combinations, so to add a new asset or yield source to the protocol you would simply create a new Vault and grow its deposits.

There is always a single PrizePool contract on each chain catering to all Prize Vaults. The second part of your question on cabina app should be deemed out of scope for the contest.


[03/07/2024 16:18] souilos
Just to make sure I understand well the "Cumulative Balance", here some "actions" are missing from the schema right?

Cumulative Balance couldn't be equal to $2200 only after the 2 deposits of $100?

[03/07/2024 16:38] infectedfuture
the cumulative is equal to balance * elapsed_time


[03/07/2024 16:38] infectedfuture
well more precisely its cumulative(t) = cumulative(t-1) + balance * elapsed_time


[03/07/2024 16:42] infectedfuture
so at t=2h 
- cumulative was $200
-  balance $200
meaning at t=12h (+10h) : cumulative(t=12h) = $200 + 10 * $200 = $2200

It is up to the prize vault deployer to also deploy the yield vault (or can chose an already existing one? not sure about that)

And today, in @PoolTogether_ contest on Code4rena, I saw another interesting way to manage prank() calls from different users / roles in a single function.

Can `yieldVault` be made by anyone?

[03/08/2024 15:35] raymondfam
You can make one or specify any yieldVault when deploying the Prize Vault, but as a trusted owner of the vault, the standard yield vault will be used. The idea is to garner as many users as possible to use your vault for the prize raffles and earn fees to the fee recipient.

Why is address(0) used by TwabERC20 on events?

This is the standard for Minting and Burning ERC20 tokens.
- Transfereing from address(0) means minting
- Transfereing to address(0) means burning

In example of the dust collection strategy in walkthrough video:
Alice made the 99$ stays at prize vault as dust
And bob creates a new share with just 1$
I thought Alice's future deposit gonna cover that 99$ to make new share not bob


[03/10/2024 01:14] raymondfam
The yield vault will be minting shares to the prize vault. The dust collection strategy in this case is simply to prevent donating dust to the yield vault. Alice and Bob will be respectively minted $99 and $1 worth of shares via TwabERC20 1:1 under normal operation regardless.

Using Prize Hooks | PoolTogether
Prize hooks are modular onchain actions, configurable by a depositor, that automatically execute when a prize is claimed for them on a standard vault.


[03/10/2024 15:35] raymondfam
This is intended as another option for prize vault promotion. If an org or prize vault creator wants to juice up their user's chance of winning, they could sponsor it. Doing this will increase the odds of winnings for the vault users. In other words, it's typically called by the prize vault owner to promote a campaign and attract more users to use the vault.

Lol am curious what ticked u off to arrive at this conclusion

I dunno myself lol, just having some feelings that some checks on the code are added as a result of an audit.


[03/10/2024 19:21] al_qa_qa
This is the version 5 of there contracts.

They made versions, audit them, lanuch them. And if there is an issue existed they fix it and launch the second version.

And we are in version 5.

But there is always something, just focus and you will get 👍

Lol yeah I got same feeling as well


[03/11/2024 08:35] 0xauditism
*re-write of the Vault contract from PT V5*, so I think it is refactored, previously audited ,code

Would be very interesting to see what kind of issues come out of this audit

Hi @RaymondFam, if I understand correctly, first pass on submissions is done by you, then a judge will go through your pre-triage, then PJQA will open?


[03/13/2024 14:33] raymondfam
Correct, but the judge will only be involved after the sponsors have gone through the findings.


[03/13/2024 14:37] infectedfuture

Wardens - Please note there was a labeling discrepancy discovered in the awarding of PoolTogether. The judge has provided clarification on their original intent and the label has been rectified accordingly. I have since deleted the awarding post here and in #📢announcements. We hope to have a new/updated award announcement in a little bit. Thanks for your patience and understanding!

[03/27/2024 01:22] wangxx2026
Any update on the response? 1.47*49 = 72.03 = H
I've never paid much attention to the distribution of the prize money, and it does seem a bit unusual when you do the math.


[03/27/2024 01:50] danieltan_metatrust
Here is the response:
- this H severity finding had a terrible 49 duplicates 
- the payouts come from the pie/split/slice calculations, https://docs.code4rena.com/awarding/incentive-model-and-awards

Lol, looks like I am not the only disappointed one.🙃

49 dups means the findings is worth = (10pts * 0.9^48) / 49

{Reactions}
☝️ 

[03/27/2024 16:34] infectedfuture
each time there's a dup, not only the value is divided by the number of dups, but also decreased by 10%, this 48 times
